        <p>
          I’m <span>Mahibalan</span>, a final year Electronics and Communication
          Engineering student with a strong interest in full-stack web
          development and embedded systems.
        </p>

        <p>
          I enjoy building real-world projects like smart parking systems,
          e-commerce platforms, and hardware-based automation using sensors and
          microcontrollers.
        </p>

        <p>
          I’m constantly learning modern technologies and love solving problems
          that combine software and hardware.
